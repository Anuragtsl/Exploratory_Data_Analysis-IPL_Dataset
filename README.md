# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-IPL_Dataset

I have done Data Analysis on IPL dataset.

In this I've used Python’s visualization techniques for analysis.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

The dataset that we use in this notebook is IPL (Indian Premier League) Dataset posted on [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl/data) sourced from cricsheet.

IPL is one of the most popular cricket tournaments in the world.

You can follow along the Jupyter Notebook for more!

# Table of Contents 

***IPL is one of the most popular cricket tournaments in the world, thus the problems we try to solve and the questions that we try to answer should be familiar to anyone who knows Cricket.***

* How many matches we’ve got in the dataset?
* How many seasons we’ve got in the dataset?
* Which Team had won by maximum runs?
* Which Team had won by maximum wicket?
* Which Team had won by closest Margin (minimum runs)?
* Which Team had won by minimum wicket?
* Which Season had most number of matches?
* Which IPL Team is more successful?
* Has Toss-winning helped in winning matches?

# Conclusion 

**Hope you liked my project on IPL Data analysis and Visualization using Python. I just listed some analysis techniques over here, to give you an idea of how to use the data set.**


#Njoy!
